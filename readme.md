Before we begin, let’s first understand:

# What is Regen Network?

The Regen Network works to align economic value with ecological health. We support the mutual prosperity of people and the planet by advocating for the inherent value of the the living world to be included economic decisions. One of the primary ways we do this is through the creation of Eco-credits which reward the regeneration of the planet. You can think of Eco-credits as a more holistic evolution of carbon credits which allow value to flow to communities stewarding the earth and practicing regeneration. Economic systems can be reimagine to regenerate ecosystems instead of exploiting them. The living world is not an externality. 

T**he Regen Network uses blockchain technology to ensure transparency, accountability, and participation in the broader effort. We at The Regen Foundation, (the not-for-profit arm of the larger network) work to ensure the network is both owned and governed by those it is meant to serve.  Ultimately… our aim is to**  aligns economics with ecological health to proliferate sovereign, bioregional, **and** regenerative economies.

# What does that mean?

- Sovereign - Communities which own their data and the value it supports, and who practice self**-**determination in their future growth and evolution through collective decisions.
- Bioregional - Rooted in place and relation to a habitat, biome, watershed, climatic zone**,** etc. Bioregional thought and action is at the core of what we do.
- Regenerative - We believe not in simply conserving nor **preserving,** but regenerating the planet through ethical and **ecological** land stewardship.
- Economies - Economies and Ecologies **can be** two sides of the same coin.

### We view regeneration as a wholistic process including the environment, humans, and healthy local economies which **have the potential to** sustain both.

# What is a “Chama”?

Chamas or VSLAs (Village Savings and Loans groups) began to spring up in the late 1980s in Kenya as a response to a lack of affordable and accessible credit. 

- At inception, these informal savings groups consisted of women who were familiar with each other, either by relation, proximity or religious affiliation.
- These self governing groups have evolved to include various loaning mechanisms and staking and rewards systems. Although these groups are unregulated, they do require registration when high thresholds are reached. It is estimated that over 300,000 registered chamas exist today in Kenya, with members collaborating in more than 1 Chama in their lifetime.

![Chamas have been used to provide social assistance in times of need, such as this Chama of elderly internally displaced women in Kenya.](Chama%20DAO%20%E2%86%92%20One%20Pager%2007c1987ae2364efb801652a45728d2f4/photo_5870990324359346593_y.jpg)

## How it all begun

To be Kenyan is to participate in a Chama, whether directly, indirectly, once or continuously. Started in the 70s as a response to inaccessible credit, these groups were formed primarily by women. 

- It has been historically seen that women started these collective savings groups, Chama, with friends, neighbours or family as this multiplied their chances of raising capital.
- The *merry-go-round*  system which is one of the most common forms of saving is done at a specified frequency (say once a week, twice a month, once a month) depending on the Chamas agreements.
- Members all agree on a baseline contribution then this amount is pooled at each meeting and given to one member. This member is then allowed to use the funds to kickstart their business venture.

## How Chamas are Democratizing Financial Systems

- Chama system, which is completely decentralised in its spirit, has managed to uphold autonomy and democracy in its governance. Decisions are made on a continual basis and each member has a single vote.
- Each chama is unique depending on its constitution and mandate. Generally, Chamas tend to adopt the system where the power and responsibility of upholding governance shifts from one member to another through the roles of a Treasurer, Chair and Secretary. This rotating system helps build empathy in the system and avoid abuse of power.
- However, in the case of Family-run Chamas, it is often seen that the head of the family or the family elders, have control over where the money is spent and how much the contributions per member should be.
- Additionally, there are Chama systems, where the individual contributions can vary depending on the individual's means. In such circumstances, contribution rates, interest rates and payback periods vary as well.

![herb_emoji.png](Chama%20DAO%20%E2%86%92%20One%20Pager%2007c1987ae2364efb801652a45728d2f4/herb_emoji.png)

## Nurturing Socio-Economic Relationships

- It can be said that the Chama is its own organism, constantly adapting to include local culture and promote compassion. This has been possible as women around the world helped to pioneer this new invention.
- Unlike traditional banks, interest rates and repayment periods, fines and collection of arrears are all done on an individual basis. For example, if one member fails to get back on time to pay back his or her Chama loan but has experienced a death in the family, there may be a social protection fund that helps the person with costs for funeral arrangements. There are also likely to be granted a grace period to get back on their feet.
- Due to this, Chamas often have relatively low repayment default rates. Additionally, Chamas operate on trust-based systems, where the individuals already know and have a relationship with existing members. Whether colleagues at work, cousins or neighbours, there is often a shared mandate and vision for the savings. This convening of shared passions is the main success factor in these groups

![herb_emoji.png](Chama%20DAO%20%E2%86%92%20One%20Pager%2007c1987ae2364efb801652a45728d2f4/herb_emoji.png)

## Eco-feminist financing

- The Chamas in Kenya were formed in the 1970's as a response to lack of access to financial resources for women including credit scores for easy access to loans. This way, women could start their own micro businesses by pooling their resources together and creating community owned funding pools. All members of the Chama would take turns to use these collective resources.
- Many rural communities resort to Chamas, where there is little to no security for getting loans. This is due to the fact that many small-holder farmers inherited their lands, a practice that never required the current formal system of securing “title deeds”.
- This means although many are land rich, but they have no education, means or resources on valuing their property and other holdings. This often leads to them making uninformed decisions when they decide to sell their land for much needed liquidity.
- This exploitation of the rural farming communities has led to their systemic oppression and poverty of the essential farming communities, the same group that often works on the frontlines to tackle the impacts of the climate crisis and are the worst affected.

Groups such as these exist in many corners of the globe and yet their efforts to regenerate the soil and mitigate the effects of Climate change go unnoticed. 

### By awarding participants such as this women’s group in Kwale,  with eco credits and allowing for them to be purchased on the [Regen Network Marketplace](https://app.regen.network/) we can provide these chamas with an opportunity to raise much needed funding to further their efforts towards regeneration.

## The evolution of the Chama

- With the increased use and development of mobile money (M-Pesa) and other digital platforms such as WhatsApp, the Chama system has evolved to go beyond geographical borders. Members can meet digitally as well as in person, agreeing on agendas remotely over chat-rooms.
- They can fund their Chama line with M-pesa as well, which can be registered under the name of a Community-based organization or under the Treasurer's name. This means increased accountability for members, who can request for statements from time to time.
- There are an estimated 300,000 chamas in Kenya today with a total of about $4 billion. However, this number could be double the amount because not all chamas are registered and work informally.

### This group like many other Chama’s in Kenya face issues with governance and accountability which have often been their greatest challenge to scale. These issues can be solved using existing technology.

# Chama ****DAO****

The Regen Foundation helps in working to empower the *sovereign, bioregional communities practicing regeneration* by providing them with the relevant tools and visibility through Web3 ledgers to provide them with a platform that will not only measure their proof of regeneration but also give them access to verifiable data on chain which can be used to increase their financial visibility.

Transaction data, contribution rates, payback periods and default rates will all be visible to any donor/investor.

Our strategy for this ambitious venture will begin with an in-depth research paper that will be published after 2 months of nationwide research in Kenya. This research aims to answer the following questions:

1. What are the major challenges faced by chamas?
2. What technologies have they leveraged thus far?
3. What are the Chama needs that the market can address?
4. Is Chama size and proximity the key marker for success and if so, will a technology that provides them a score be beneficial to their overall fundraising strategy?
5. Is there a correlation between Chama success and the amount of funding available to them?

![herb_emoji.png](Chama%20DAO%20%E2%86%92%20One%20Pager%2007c1987ae2364efb801652a45728d2f4/herb_emoji.png)

## The Research Project

We anticipate that by rewarding Chamas practicing regeneration, we will create a compounding effect, where groups will be encouraged and incentivized to report those practices and in-turn have access funding that can supplement their incomes. 

Most farmers in Kenya would enthusiastically welcome initiatives of these models which could help them over their biggest challenge, lack of financial resources, to continue their regenerative agricultural practices.

- The aim of this project is to create a research publication on the current state, models and practices of Chama systems in Kenya.
- This publication will further be used to fundraise to run the proposed pilot in collaboration relevant partners such as Filecoin and Shamba Network

![chama info.png](Chama%20DAO%20%E2%86%92%20One%20Pager%2007c1987ae2364efb801652a45728d2f4/chama_info.png)

**The research will inform the development of various open source technologies that can reroute financing to where it is needed most**. By incentivizing regenerative agriculture, we can increase food security and continually reward land stewards for their best practices.

This however needs to be done by integrating ecological, economic, and human well-being. We aim  to do this by using both local and ancient wisdom and emerging technologies and concepts related to decentralization.

## **Our Approach**

- We support climate justice initiatives with DAO technologies, and evolve DAO technologies with the insights and legacies of climate justice initiatives. It’s a reciprocal process. Put another way, we incubate regenerative DAOs.
- We leverage tools related to blockchain and decentralised ownership to channel resources to land based communities. We work to anchor their stake in a future economy where value and planetary health are fundamentally aligned.
- We don’t solely focus on carbon, rather see it as one of a multitude of forces defining regeneration.

## Could we do this through Ecosystem Services?

![Screen Shot 2022-10-03 at 10.53.53 PM.png](Chama%20DAO%20%E2%86%92%20One%20Pager%2007c1987ae2364efb801652a45728d2f4/Screen_Shot_2022-10-03_at_10.53.53_PM.png)

- The schematic above illustrates a simple example of compensation for commons stewardship as a loop.
    - Upstream : Communities practice Regenerative Land Stewardship supporting essential ecological functions. Have a look at many [here](https://www.notion.so/Built-On-Regen-Network-c6266114116842e389258747454f9f07)!
    - Eco - Credits : Planetary regeneration means habitat for biodiversity, replenishing of aquafers, erosion control, decontamination and so much more! Ecocredits are ways of proving regeneration has happened. Credits are typically quantifiable, and transparent about their verifiability. They don’t have to be outcome based. Some are based on practices over outcomes. Have a look [here](https://www.regen.network/case-studies/)!
    - Downstream : Regen is building a market for the voluntary purchase of regenerative ecocredits. See the beta site [here](https://app.regen.network/).
    - Payment : Ecocredits purchased are typically retired. This means the work of the regenerators has be paid for by a buyer who believes in the value of their work and the ecosystems function.

### Ecocredits are much more than just carbon sequestration. By rewriting the integrity of carbon credits  to include support for greater ecological and economic health, Regen Network builds a system to support regenerative communities in a wholistic way.
